A long time ago, when the company started noticing a decline in the website, I programmed in a backdoor just in case they deleted it. Seems I programmed it at a good time.
                        The RECOVER program was successful in recovering most of the website, but large portions of it are still missing. We, as in, the people of RECOVER, exist to archive websites and features that will be lost to time without our intervention. All the programs or websites that would be lost to time we find, save, and archive for those who wish to see them in the future. Feature Future Foundation no longer owns the website, and we are currently in the process of restoring things that were almost lost.
                        We cannot thank you enough for assisting us in this problem. If you are interested, why don’t you join us? We could always use someone like you to help us in the future. Think it over, we’ll be in touch.</marquee>

        <h2>Who is Feature Future Foundation?</h2>
        <p>Feature Future foundation started first as a small company working under a larger firm, many bet that the company would be fully merged by the end of the year. After the launch of our first plugin "All Together Now" the company was able to go independent and continue to make quality products for everyone, businesses, and people alike! Our work has contributed to over 90% of the content found on the internet, and we constantly strive to improve it every day for everyone, making it faster and more reliable that it was yesterday.</p>        <br>
