<p style="color: white;">To anyone who reads this, there's not much time. <br> ▇▇▇▇▇ is hiding something, something big. <br> I left this backdoor for people to find should the day come. <br> Find the clues. <br> ▇▇▇▇▇ couldn't find them, but it will uncover the truth. <br> Don't trust them, find ▇▇▇▇▇, before it's too late. <br> I'll leave clues when I can, but I can't make them too obvious. <br> Find a way to open the backdoor. Stop the website from being shut down. <br> You're the only hope we have of uncovering the truth.</p>
